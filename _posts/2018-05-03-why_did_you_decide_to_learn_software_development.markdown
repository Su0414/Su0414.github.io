After completing my bachelor’s in engineering, I started my career as software developer, worked for few years.

Then, after my marriage and having 2 young kids, I took break from career as my husband was travelling for work and kids were very young. We were very far from our home country and knew very few people here. 
I enjoyed spending time with kids but my career was getting side tracked.

I am sure many women can relate to changes that happen in their life and career, after having kids and added family responsibilities.  

But I want to tell all women that stay focused on what you want to do and believe the result is going to be good. Things start rolling and you get a lot of support from your family and friends.

I stepped out and I got an opportunity to work as HR for a staffing company and after gaining experience from my job,

I started my own Consulting company. While I was building website for my company I was realised how rusty my coding skills were.  For the growth of the company, building my development skills became important. 

I thought that this is the time I can upgrade my technical skills. Then I started learning various online resources and soon was overwhelmed by the changes in technology and was thinking it will take me forever to learn so many new skills. 

So I was looking for a more structured course which shall guide me with technical skills and
I can be part of large community, I can talk with mentors along. 

I am glad I took this big step with Flatiron School and I am very excited for where this journey shall take me. 
I think it shall help me take financial responsibility for my family and business as well. 

I wished I could have taken this step earlier but even if ideally you want to do lot of multitasking everyday you need time and focus on building your art. For me today is my time and opportunity. 

I just want to say don’t get overwhelmed that Technology is advancing at very rapid rate. 

Just get your hands dirty, start practicing and lean in today and enjoy this process ! 

Keep calm and code !!
