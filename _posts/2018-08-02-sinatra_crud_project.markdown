It has happened with me a number of times before, that ....
I had some great project ideas in mind, .....wrote it down somewhere .....and they are still there in some notebooks......

It makes me really happy that I implemented this project idea from scratch and it is taking shape in the form of a project.

Sinatra project gives you chance to brainstorm and be creative. 

**Momentum is the Key !**

I would like to share with you some of the **important concepts** and **good reading resources** I came across while doing this project. 

**Sinatra**
* Domain Specific Language implemented in Ruby. 
* It is a Rack-based (Ruby web server interface) web application framework. 
* Rack based means it can fit into any Rack-based application stack,including Rails. 
* Sinatra provides a minimal interface for writing web applications in Ruby

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. 
* Gives a very **clean separation of concerns**
* Each of these components are built to handle specific development tasks of an application. 
* MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. 
* The views for a specific model are also grouped together.
* Models can have multiple views.

**CRUD** (create, read , update, delete) operations . These are the four basic functions of persistent storage.

**ORM Mapping** 
A technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages

**REST**
Representational State Transfer (REST)

**Activerecord Associations** 
Active record pattern is an architectural pattern found in software that stores in-memory object data in relational databases.
When designing your models, you need to define relationships like has_many, belongs_to , has_many_through or many to many. This link provides these details with examples
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html

**ActiveRecord Validations** 
Validation plays important role in this application. 
Activerecord has detail guide for this , Must read while implementing validations

**Happy Coding !!**
